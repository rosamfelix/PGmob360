### GTFS

General Transit Feed Specification (GTFS) is [standard format](https://developers.google.com/transit/gtfs/reference) for documenting public transportation information, including: routes, schedules, stop locations, calendar patterns, trips, and possible transfers.
Transit agencies are responsible for maintaining the data up-to-date.

This information is used in several applications, such as Google Maps, to provide public transportation directions.
It can be offered for a city, a region, or even a whole country, depending on the PT agency.

The recent version 2 of the GTFS standard includes more information, such as **real-time data**.

The data is usually in a `.zip` file that includes several `.txt` files (one for each type of information) with tabular relations.

## Online sources

You can find most GTFS data in the following websites:

-   [TransitLand](https://www.transit.land)
-   [TransitFeeds](https://transitfeeds.com/)

Some PT agencies also provide their open-data in their websites.

## R packages

There are some nice R packages to read and manipulate GTFS data, such as:

-   [`tidytransit`](https://r-transit.github.io/tidytransit/)
-   [`gtfstools`](https://ipeagit.github.io/gtfstools/)

Be aware that they may share the same function names, so it is important to use of of them at the time.
